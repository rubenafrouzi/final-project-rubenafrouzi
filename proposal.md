# 2D Game proposal

## Repository
<https://github.com/rubenafrouzi/final-project-rubenafrouzi.git>

## Description
I'd like to use Pygame to create a simple 2D platformer set in a science fiction world. We used pygame in lab c08, and I'd like to learn more about it so that I can create more projects with it in the future.

## Features
- Player movement
	- Add funtions to handle player actions like walking, jumping, wall jumping, and basic combat.
- Enemy Ai
	- I need to define basic enemy patterns, such as patrolling or chasing the player, possibly using Pygame's collision detection logic.
- Tilemap system 
	- Make a grid-based system for the game world using pyhame's tilemap libraries.

## Challenges
- I'll have to learn how to add sprites to Pygame.
- I'll need to learn about Pygames' other features, like collisions and the tilemap library.
- I'll need to play around with the math part of the code to ensure that the player controller feels good.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A 2D platformer with multiple levels and a clear goal/mini-story

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A 2D platformer with a basic premise and at least 1 full level complete

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Player movement
  2. Tilemap system/ basic map

- Week 2
  1. Enemy movement
  2. Start on graphics/ sprite work

- Week N (Final)
  1. Particle effects and overall gamefeel/polish
  2. 1 full medium sized level finished
